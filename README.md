# KeDa Tech Frontend Test Assignment

Building a radio group component in Vue.

## Challenges

- Uncertainty with unit testing

Frontend components doesn't seem to be suitable for use with unit testing,
especially when components rely on other components to make up the whole thing.
I've also had troubles trying to set up Jest properly, so for now it's being
supplanted with E2E testing via Cypress instead.

## Setup

- [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) is recommended
- `pnpm install`

### Development

- `pnpm run dev`

### Build

- `pnpm run build`
- `pnpm run preview`
